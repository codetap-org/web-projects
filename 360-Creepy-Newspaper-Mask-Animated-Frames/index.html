        <span class="news__highlight">CODEPEN CITY, Oct. 31 —</span> The
        three-year reign of terror attributed to the so-called "Halloween
        Hostess" came to a grim and sudden end this morning, as police
        discovered the body of the suspected slayer, Evelyn Harlow, on the
        floor of her own kitchen. Harlow, 28, whose shocking beauty and
        alleged depravity have held this city in a grip of fear every October,
        was found dead at approximately 7:30 a.m. by officers responding to a
        welfare check. Police found Harlow, clad in a floral house dress and a
        string of pearls, lying supine on the checkered linoleum of her
        otherwise tidy home on Elmview Avenue. Authorities noted several empty
        green bottles scattered on the floor near her body, though a
        definitive cause of death is pending a full report from the coroner's
        office. "It's a grim denouement to a dark chapter for Codepen City,"
        stated a weary Police Chief Miles Brody, who was on the scene. "While
        the investigation is in its earliest stages, the city can rest easier
        tonight knowing Mrs. Harlow will not be hosting any more of her...
        gatherings." That chilling moniker was earned after a series of
        gruesome slayings that paralyzed the city. For the past three autumns,
        unsuspecting gentlemen, lured by Harlow's considerable charm, would
        vanish just before Halloween. Their bodies were discovered days later,
        posed in macabre, theatrical tableaus resembling ghoulish holiday
        decorations in various abandoned parts of the city. The constabulary
        had been baffled, unable to connect the poised, elegant Evelyn
        Harlow—a woman known for her prize-winning roses and quiet demeanor—to
        the string of fiendish murders. "She was always so... put together,"
        said Mrs. Agnes Pinter, a neighbor who had alerted the police after
        noticing Harlow's morning papers piling up. "She'd borrow a cup of
        sugar! To think... to think that was living right across the street...
        it's just dreadful. And to be found this way, on Halloween of all
        nights! It's like something out of a pulp novel." To her neighbors,
        Evelyn Harlow was a charming, if reclusive, widow. But to the few
        detectives who suspected her, she was a cunning and twisted mind, a
        "black widow" who turned the wholesome traditions of autumn into a
        stage for her grotesque art. Detectives are now meticulously tearing
        the seemingly quaint home apart, searching for evidence that will
        definitively link Harlow to the half-dozen murders. They are seeking
        poisons, trophies, and, most of all, a diary or journal that might
        explain the madness behind the mask of beauty. "What drives a woman of
        her poise and breeding to such depravity... is a question we may never
        answer," Chief Brody added, addressing reporters on the lawn. "The
        scene inside suggests a tragic end, but whether it was a case of her
        own twisted games finally catching up to her, or an accidental
        overdose, remains to be seen." As dusk falls on Codepen City and
        children in costume prepare to take to the streets, the shadow that
        has long loomed over this holiday has finally lifted. But for the
        residents of Elmview Avenue, the memory of the beautiful woman in the
        tidy house at number 214 will remain a chilling reminder that true
        monsters often wear the most convincing masks.
